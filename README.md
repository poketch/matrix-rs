## Matrix

This is just a basic library crate with a matrix implentation so I can implement the Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm. 


## Outcomes

My implementation of the algorithm is too slow (probably) it's still faster to double loop through and multiply. 
Maybe this would be different if I benchmarked much larger matrices, but I'm doubtful.

Not sure if I will return to this project
